	PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Being the newest and most innovated mapping app on the market, 
kiloMaps is here to illustrate floorplans before any remodeling 
ever takes place! Thanks to kiloMaps, users will be able to create a 
virtual room, fill it with furniture, and drag and drop that 
furniture however they please.


	USER STORY:
"AS A secretly passionate interier designer, or as a normal person who
likes to plan ahead...

I WANT a deployed app that will create a floor plan for my future space... 

SO THAT organizing, choosing and buying furniture is less of an ordeal or risk!"

Wether moving into a new place, contructing a new building, or simply 
remodeling, kiloMaps is the app for you! As long as the parameters of 
rooms are known, users can simply create a virtual box to resemble 
the space. Users can then choose parameters of shapes, from a list 
of predetermined shapes, and insert a "drag and droppable" version
into the virtual room. Once the item exists in the space it will be 
added to a list on a side panel.The side panel will also be an 
interactive *selector* that highlights the current shape selected.
Users will also be able to save their kiloMap by making an account 
authenticated by email and password. Printer friendly options for 
the kiloMap will also be possible.

	WIREFRAME/DESIGN DRAFT:
wireframe.png within assets/images/wireframe.png has the wireframe kinda..


	APIs TO BE USED:
zzz.dog
firebase
Bulma.io *


	TASK BREAKDOWN:
Learn zdog and firebase.
Build website framework
write function for generating and listing shapes

....
....
bug fix



	FUTURE GOAL FOR PROJECT:
App that lets your parameterize size of generalized prism shapes and 
place them in home like w/ augmented reality. 
(ex: rectagular prism, spheres, pyramid, triangular prisms, ect)
